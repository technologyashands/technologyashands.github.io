NEW YORK IS MY TEMPLE series

6×4″ painted digital photographs, 2012-2015

Abstract painter, Emily Church has completed a new series of visual studies she has been working on for years. Drawing on the inspiration found in her everyday environment, she uses her iphone to capture imagery which she prints on Kodak paper and paints with acrylic paint to become unique and new compositions which ultimately feed into all of her abstract work.

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"NEW YORK IS MY TEMPLE is about looking at, then seeing the urban space I inhabit. Taking in all the gritty pavement, the walls, and the natural spaces too. It is about looking for surprises. Passing the same places over again and one day the light falls just so, or a wall has a new splash of paint, or a layer has been scraped away to reveal beauty beneath. It is about the daily meditation of walking the same routes but seeing each new day filled with emergent forms, passing clouds, changing seasons, human life piling upon itself remaking the city.

I do not set out to photograph, and the pictures I take are spontaneously taken on my iPhone. They are very much about being in a place during a certain moment in time, and making a note to myself about a shape, the look of shadows along a wall, the way buildings come together to form surprising spaces. I have the notes printed. These notes I carry back to the studio. Some have been lining my walls and desk for years. And when the mood strikes, I paint over the photographs with no concrete agenda, and with a clear mind, like a meditation. The image that emerges reveals itself to be what lay behind my initial intention upon capturing the photo. The finished painting becomes an abstraction of a place and time --a distortion of "reality" that allows me to step into the space of art." - Emily Church
