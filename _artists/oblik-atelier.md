Mia Hebib of Oblik Atelier hand forms all of her unique jewelry pieces. For this show, Mia is interested in exploring how scanning and 3D printing a copy of her hand formed piece yields different or similar results.
We'll be seeing both the hand formed piece as well as it's 3D printed version to explore the differences!

##PROCESS

(coming soon!)

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"I am curious about it and I'm keeping my toes just lightly dipped.
Question of manufacturing and producing my work comes up frequently. My pieces are wearable sculpture because of how they are made. Part of the charm for me is that each form is slightly different and each process involves my hands (or hands of others that help in the process) 

I would be curious to go through the process of digitally scanning my bracelet and then having it printed in either directly in  metal or plastic and then cast.
Part of it is learning about scanning and how much detail does it retain- and then what happens to the bracelet's wearability once it's produced in such a way." - Mia Hebib
