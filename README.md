Support Your Local Maker
========

This project has been built by @tomcritchlow. It's my first ever Github project so please forgive any mistakes or problems with forking/branching and brunching or whatever it is Github lets you do.

So here's how you can add your own link to the site.

1) Email me at tjcritchlow@gmail.com

2) Fork/commit/merge/branch whatever a file called sitename.md in the _brooklyn folder. The formatting should be the same as the other files in there. And add your image (350px x 350px) to the images folder.

Pull requests welcome - I'm not precious about the design at all.

Oh - and if you're really ambitious and want to add your own city aside from Brooklyn then please do. I think the site structure would work pretty easily with a /austin or /sanfrancisco or /boston or whatever.

Thank you and happy holiday!
