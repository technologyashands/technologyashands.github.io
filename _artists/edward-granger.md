##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"I've always been interested in creating works that ask the viewer to participate in the dialogue and/or the interaction between the object and environment. My aesthetic plays with the underlying graphs, threads, and fibers of color space technologies behind print and digital images through collage and large scale painting, allowing the threads and fibers to work together in various spatial, line and color pattern techniques.

Looking at these color space as recordings of pixels and atoms, and how each pixel is made up of an unmixed pot of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). The interplay of form and color are executed and recreated through digital graphs and stencils morphed through various illustrator and photoshop programs, then overplayed onto the physical composition at hand. These color space pixels or atoms in the digital and physical form are connected everywhere and become ubiquitous." - Edward Granger
