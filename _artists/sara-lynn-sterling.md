##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"As a photographer who prefers film, I often find I am speaking out against technology in regards to photography. Digital photography has increased the cost of using and developing film and prints and decreased the number and types of dark rooms available. Digital photography has also made analog photography that much more special and unique, because the process of analog photography creates a more unique and one of a kind print.  But as a busy New Yorker, who cannot always travel with my cameras, I also appreciate how many advances have been made in digital photography and handheld devices.  I can now take high resolution photographs with something that fits in my pocket and can share these images worldwide. In hand, I have a constant sources of inspiration and the ability to never miss a shot. For this show, this ability has been transformed into unique and one of a kind digital String Theory pieces, each image highlighting both the beauty of New York and the advancements of handheld digital technology." - Sara Lynn Sterling
