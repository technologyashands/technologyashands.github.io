##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY
"The tablets in " Peaks to Rise" aren't high tech flat screens. They are hand-made relief sculptures that depict landscapes in which the natural and the technological compete and converge.They are composed from the shapes and patterns of defunct technology - pieces of plastic lattice from a broken printer, components from computers and calculators, parts of discarded appliances along with an eagle, a woman, and mountain ranges. These forms and textures are pressed into sheets of styrofoam and the resulting impressions are cast in hydrocal. These landscapes refer to ancient forms of writing and relief sculpture while responding to our brave new touchscreen and e-waste world.These tablets push into relief the textures that lie beneath technology's glossy surface, to expose their beauty, to explore the impact of technological progress on our natural environment, and to imagine what marks our civilization may leave behind." - Sara Mejia Kriendler
