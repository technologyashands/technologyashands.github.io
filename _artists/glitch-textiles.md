Brooklyn based artist and designer, Phillip David Stearns is founder and creator the stunning weaves behind Glitch Textiles.
These woven throws are not only cozy (we own one!), but they create subtle structures of our digital reality into intimate, tactile materials. Phillip's designs are expressions of the abstract and invisible language of digital technologies. He believes that the immaterial world of the digital has a vital materiality, and that materiality has the power to touch and move us. We're simply moved by their beauty.

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"Electronic media operate primarily on only two of our senses: sight and hearing. Though I work with media technologies, electronics and electronic media, I tend to focus on condensing these in such a way that the technologies, tools, and media themselves become entangled with what would normally be read as the content or the message. As electronic media (digital or analog), images, video, and sound become reduced to signal—a manifestation of some order defined within a certain system—Light and Sound themselves become raw materials for reconstituting electronic signals back into physiological experience.

Through deconstruction and reconfiguration the technologically mediated environment is approached as an assemblage, where human activity plays a role of equivalent importance to environmental agency. From this perspective, the development and application of our technologies, machines and tools reveals our perceptual biases, desires, dreams and fears—both conscious and unconscious. Cultural values and meaning, then, can be viewed as derivative, shaped by the particular conditions facilitating the distribution of agency through cascading exchanges of mediated interactions." - Phillip David Stearns of Glitch Textiles
