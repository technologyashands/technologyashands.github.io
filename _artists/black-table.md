Carlos Meza thrives in the profound effect that new technologies have on architecture and design. He currently explores ideas of architecture, traditional crafting and digital design processes throughsmall functional and non-functional objects, implementing materials and techniques traditionally used in architecture, such as concrete and wood. 

His proposal is translated into simple objects, where the use of concrete is presented in a raw state in fully contrast with the smoothness and sharpness of other materials like resins and woods. His objects becomes an honest transformation of an ordinary piece into a truly untraditional object of desire.

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY
"Intertwined wood and concrete: table and cutting/serving boards. These two objects come together

by mixing techniques traditionally used in carpentry and in architecture. 

In these pieces, wood and concrete are deeply joined. Still, this mixture of wood joinery and 

concrete craft is mutually exclusive. Wood’s nature tends towards both expansion and contraction, 

concrete's nature doesn’t. It cracks. Hence, a rubber band thoughtfully inserted in between both 

materials performs as a buffer zone that allows the wood to freely move without damaging the 

concrete. This concept is based in several architecture construction methods that allow materials to 

expand and contract without affecting neither their environment nor their adjunct pieces. 

The wood and mold that cast the concrete are shaped using a CNC router. This allows the wood 

and the concrete to come together with rigorous accuracy." - Carlos Meza
