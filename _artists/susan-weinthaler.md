Susan Weinthaler makes individual works of art called Bits. Each Bit is outfitted with a magnetic backing and is mounted on a steel canvas with other works to create a collection with infininte arrangements. Susan encourages the viewer to engage with her work and explore all of it's possibilities.

Susan's newest work, which is currently being created, explores the usage of a vinegar solution and a car battery to etch unique artworks onto her metallic surfaces. This permanent etching process was discovered through online research.

##MY USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY
"I am an artist that has largely resisted using modern technology directly in my work. However, recently I found myself on an airplane flying home to NYC after seeing family, surfing the Internet via a wireless connection on my battery powered laptop, exchanging rapid-fire emails with Erin regarding this show, and I realized that this luddite concept of myself was not true at all. It became apparent to me that indeed technology was hugely involved on so many levels of what I do. While I was navigating through Wikipedia up there in the clouds conducting research, I came across “the Tree of Life”, an ancient concept that alludes to the interconnection of all life on our planet, and also serves as a metaphor for common descent in the evolutionary sense. It was then I looked out the window to see streets branching out in tree-like patterns beneath our plane as were landing that my head exploded. Now I see branches everywhere, of course in trees and plants, but also in lightning and electricity, dendrites and synapses, cracks and fissures, veins and capillaries, roadways and maps, and of course the phylogenetic family tree, just to name a few." - Susan Weinthaler
