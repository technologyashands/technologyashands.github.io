##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"From idea to sketch to prototype to product, the range
of technology behind our goods is part of why we love 
what we do. We sketch with pencils, make cardboard 
cut-outs, and scribble on four colors of carbon paper. 
We fabricate elaborate templates and jigs, and make 
moulds out of rubber and clay. We carve patterns and 
mix colors, pour liquids and cut wood. Recently, with 
the introduction of a CNC router to our shop 
(potentially unseating our custom-built pantograph 
router), we entered the mysterious realm of computer-
aided fabrication; essentially typing some numbers into 
a computer and watching a robot do (some of) the work. 
What’s not to like?

Every piece of technology, new or old, brings gifts and 
challenges. One definition of the word technology is, 
literally, “cunning of hand”. We embrace any tool that 
makes for an easier job or a better result. We like our 
computers and our mechanicals and our charcoal on 
paper. It’s the mix of these approaches that takes us 
the distance between an idea and an object with 
presence and beauty. When crafting an object, there are 
always actions of certainty and actions of risk. That’s 
the drama that draws us in as makers, no matter what the tool." - Noble Goods
