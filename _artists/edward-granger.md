##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"I've always been interested in creating works that ask the viewer to participate in the dialogue and/or interaction between the object and environment. My aesthetic often plays with the underlying graphs, threads, and fibers of color space technologies behind print and digital images through collage and large scale painting, allowing these threads and fibers to work together in various spatial, line and color pattern techniques to create a language of their own.

Looking at these color spaces as recordings of pixels and atoms, and how each pixel is made up of an unmixed pot of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). The interplay of form and color are executed and recreated through digital graphs and stencils morphed through various illustrator an photoshop programs, then overlaid onto the physical composition at hand. These color space pixels or atoms in the digital and physical form eventually become ubiquitous but tell us everything." - Edward Granger
