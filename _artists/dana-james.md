RED BREATHER

Oil and encaustic on canvas, 60 x 48 Inches, 2015

Dana James' studies in abstraction hold hints and nuances of technology which lingers almost as the underlying residue of our modern existence and daily lives. It's incredible to see how her work morphs through the process shots.

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY
"My painting is based on the concept that the super natural is the only natural. I view the inner workings of technology to be in the realm of the super natural, a fantastical phenomena disguised into the perfunctory. The imagery in my work reflects every day objects that act as couriers of technology and science. Transient Pool is illustrative of a television both in appearance and the process in which it was made. The entire center image is emerging from the back of the canvas rather than the surface, just as a television set would operate mechanically. Cassette depicts the idea of sound waves and water in reference to a musical cassette tape, a form hidden inside the painting. In Red Breather, a supernatural light is breathing through a horizon line, such as when the television breaks in and out of power. The employment of technology in every day life also casts an undertone of Americana in my work; its the catharsis that basis itself off of the "zombified" state caused by the television or computer screen, by music, and household objects. Perhaps most importantly, I am interested in nature as truth, and technology as a falsified or manipulated truth. The imagery of water in coalesce with technology is a narrative of this dichotomy." -Dana James
