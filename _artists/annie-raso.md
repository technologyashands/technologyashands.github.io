About Annie: Annie went to SUNY New Paltz to study art, but soon discovered that it was woodworking that she loved as it was the perfect blend of math, science, physics, art, design, mechanics, and functionality. We absolutely love her little ring boxes, Annie makes special selections of woods and loves to work with really difficult and oily ones...we got to feast our eyes on a coveted piece of ebony she's been saving for the perfect project. She's a chick amongst the bros in a large shared wood shop in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY, but that doesn't stop Annie from wearing her skirt to work and building a nasty domino set specially for some shop downtime together. 

As mentioned in her interview, Annie loves to focus on working small...attention to detail allows her to assure perfection. "I love love love working small. The smaller the better. When Iâ€™m working, my mood is always proportionate to the size of the piece- the bigger the piece, the crankier I get." (did we mention we also love her sense of humor??)

Annie Raso is building incredible electronic lamps! Neat.
