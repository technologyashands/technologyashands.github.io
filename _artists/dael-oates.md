Dael will be showcasing digital captures he took of Fiercely Made knifemaker, Chelsea Miller's tools after shooting a video about her.

##PROCESS

Dael created a rig using a ladder to create an aerial tripod for his camera which was positioned directly overhead Chelsea Miller's steel work bench for precise captures. His shots were taken through his computer which was connected to his camera. Technology at it's finest!
