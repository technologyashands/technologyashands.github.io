##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"These clocks are deeply linked with technology both aesthetically and functionally. First and foremost they feature a mechanism which uses quartz crystal integrated with electronic and mechanical parts to tell time. Despite being invented almost 90 years ago this type of mechanism is the most widely used timekeeping technology today. The combination of electron, mechanical and crystal parts also makes them much more accurate then the best mechanical timepieces. 

We also utilize modern technology to produce the pieces. The wood that we use comes from local lumberyards who source it from American forests. When we receive the boards they usually measure 13” wide by 7’ long. We use a CNC router which is basically an extremely accurate drill bit controlled by the computer to drill out the area for the clock mechanism. 

For the screen printed pieces designs are drawn, painted or designed in Illustrator. After they are scanned into the computer the pieces are cleaned up and manipulated using photoshop or illustrator. You can usually tell which pieces were designed in the computer because they are way too clean and usually feature repetitive lines. The cleaned up pieces are printed out onto transparent paper. We use this to create screens for screen printing, which was at the cutting edge of technology a 100 years ago in 1910. 

Our designs are also aesthetically linked to technology. In this digital age where all information and influences are available at all times to everyone; the artists imagination is no longer bound to the location they are from and the places they have been. Our pieces draw from all different influences as a result. Some take aesthetic cues from far flung inspirations like Art Deco, 70’s poster art, computer chips, 80’s track suits or minimalism. Most of our pieces use angles and bright colors to create a tension in the composition that keeps the piece interesting time after time. " - Joe Silver and Justin Horowitz of Westkill
