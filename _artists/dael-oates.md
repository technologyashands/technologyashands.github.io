##PROCESS

Dael created a rig using a ladder to create an aerial tripod for his camera which was positioned directly overhead Chelsea Miller's steel work bench for precise captures. His shots were taken through his computer which was connected to his camera. Technology at it's finest!

##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"Artists and Makers tools have always fascinated me. These seemingly inanimate objects, when in the hands of a creator can be incredibly powerful.  And when photographed this way we celebrate the object as a powerful piece of art unto itself.  I love how this allows the tool or object, that would otherwise be overlooked as a part of the workspace, to suddenly transcend the space and become a studied and considered piece of art.  Naturally when I met Chelsea and made a Point of View film of her process, I saw her undeniable energy and passion in her work.  I naturally wanted to explore the work space and all the various tools and objects that are around her when she creates such beautiful knives. Then, when arranged, these objects become a story, almost like hieroglyphic images of tools we might see on an archeological stone wall. Marking her creation process and the things used as there own precious art form." -Dael Oates
