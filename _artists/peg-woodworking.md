##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"Coming from a background in sculpture I began making custom designed furniture in 2013 incorporating elements of hand made joinery, Danish cord weaving, crochet, macrame and shaker techniques. 

I have always been greatly influenced by complex geometric patterning found in Peruvian weaving, Navajo rugs and Islamic tile. These patterns which verge on optical illusions are referenced regularly in the design process. Most pieces begin with a drawn geometric inspiration that evolves to fit the design. Each piece is custom and hand made with unique woven accents. 

Wanting to learn seat weaving I turned to online tutorials which showed the Shaker and Danish cord weaving process. After a short time mimicking the traditional techniques I realized there were material and technical limitations that I kept encountering. This caused me to look at more artistic less utilitarian weaving and knotting processes such as tapestry and macrame. Filling up on online tutorials I was able to combine a series of techniques to form the weaving process I now use." - Kate Casey of Peg Woodworking
