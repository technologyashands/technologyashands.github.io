##USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY

"My light pieces are like abstract dioramas, minimalist tableaux that exist independently from their surroundings, glowing from within. In them light is an object, a medium: it dialogues and relates with surfaces, forms and materials, making the picture appear in its finished state.

Electric light has a whimsical quality to it, being awe-inspiring and ordinary at the same time. On one hand we seek out its greatness and brilliance, constantly pushing forward its seemingly limitless powers, on the other it is so common we are often unaware of it. Everyday we come across beautiful luminous experiences, small miracles that take place everywhere but go mostly unnoticed: light comes in a million shapes or forms and are all sublime in their own way – like Isamu Noguchi once said “any glowing object is a source of delight”. I try to render these great, small phenomenons in my work very much in the same way a landscape painter strives to evoke the look and feel of the scenery around him.

I arrived at this medium through the stage, having trained Theatre Design.Theatre was part of the process that made me look at light differently in the first place, and taught me its potential for seduction and illusion. On the stage light is the catalyst, the be all and end all: everything is subjected to it and everything exists because of it. 

The inclination to use words has crept in more and more in the past couple of years, a result of my fascination with all luminous signage: the very concept of a message that is conveyed and amplified by light, that becomes more powerful and alluring through light, for me is simply amazing.

It also stems from a desire to bring my work to a more expressive level: by contrast my light installations are often about formal elegance and balance, so I was compelled to develop works where I could really say something. I play with the rawness of words and phrases placed within formal, startlingly graceful settings." -Matilde Alessandra
