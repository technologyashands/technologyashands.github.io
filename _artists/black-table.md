Carlos Meza thrives in the profound effect that new technologies have on architecture and design. He currently explores ideas of architecture, traditional crafting and digital design processes throughsmall functional and non-functional objects, implementing materials and techniques traditionally used in architecture, such as concrete and wood. 

His proposal is translated into simple objects, where the use of concrete is presented in a raw state in fully contrast with the smoothness and sharpness of other materials like resins and woods. His objects becomes an honest transformation of an ordinary piece into a truly untraditional object of desire.
